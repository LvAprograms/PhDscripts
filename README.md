## Data download
https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/topo/gltiles.html and download 'g10g'  and 'h10g' 

## Program usage
Run the showcase model after downloading the data and putting it in the same directory as the python program.
Look at the topography, pick your own profile line (rows are vertical coords, columns horizontal coords) and run
```
$ python3 Topomap.py rs cs re ce
```
where rs, cs, re and ce are starting and ending row and columns.

Enjoy!
